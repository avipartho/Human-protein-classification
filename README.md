# Human-protein-classification
An ongoing work for my MSc Thesis.

The objective is to perform multi label classification of mixed protein patterns from 4-channel (RGBY) confocal microscopy images. The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification/data). This repo will be updated as things progress.
